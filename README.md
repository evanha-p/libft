# libft
Libft project for HIVE Helsinki

Here's a collection of my libft created at HIVE Helsinki.
Most of the functions are mandatory for the assignment but there are some I created specifically (e.g. ft_countnodes.c) because I saw them beneficial to my workflow. I use this libft extensivile with my other projects and as such it will also pop up in other repositories of mine.
